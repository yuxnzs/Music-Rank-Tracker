/// A model representing the items of the tab view.

/// A ``Tab`` enum is used to define the available items in a tab-based UI. Each tab has an associated `id`, `name`,
/// `icon`, and `activeColor` properties. The `id` property is used to uniquely identify each, while the `name`
/// property is used to display the label of the tab item. The `icon` property is used to display a corresponding icon,
/// and the `activeColor` property contains the specify `Color` used for the active tab item.
///
/// The code below shows a sample `Tab` enum which contains five tab items including:
///
/// * Nature
/// * Travel
/// * Fitness
/// * Food
/// * Interior design
